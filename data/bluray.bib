abstract = {In this paper, we examine the performance of a Blu-ray disk (BD) aspheric lens as the objective of a miniaturized scanning nonlinear optical microscope. By combining a single 2D micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) mirror as the scanner and with different tube lens pairs, the field of view (FOV) of the studied microscope varies from 59 $\mu$m {\texttimes} 93 $\mu$m up to 178 $\mu$m {\texttimes} 280 $\mu$m, while the corresponding lateral resolution varies from 0.6 $\mu$m to 2 $\mu$m for two-photon fluorescence (2PF) signals. With a 34/s video frame rate, in vivo dynamic observation of zebrafish heartbeat through 2PF of the excited green fluorescence protein (GFP) is demonstrated.},
